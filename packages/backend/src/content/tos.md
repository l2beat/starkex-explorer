**Last Updated:** 2024-09-18

## **1. General Information**

### **1.1. About Us**

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the dYdX Explorer ("the Explorer"), operated by L2BEAT, a limited liability company (spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością) with its registered office in Warsaw at Poznańska 16/4, 00-680 Warsaw, Poland.

### **1.2. Acceptance of Terms**

By accessing or using the Explorer, you agree to be bound by these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use the Explorer.

## **2. Description of Services**

### **2.1. Nature of Service**

The Explorer is a user interface designed to facilitate interactions with the dYdX exchange and its underlying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. L2BEAT does not execute any actions independently, as the Explorer merely serves as a tool for users to interact with these third-party smart contracts. All blockchain transactions created with the help of the Explorer are submitted to the blockchain through the users’ wallet applications and then executed by the blockchain without further action from either the Explorer or L2BEAT. L2BEAT does not guarantee the functionality, security, or accuracy of any smart contracts accessed through the Explorer, nor can it ensure that they are bug-free or will work as intended.

### **2.2. Third-Party Independence**

- **dYdX Exchange**: The dYdX exchange is operated independently by its own operators, and L2BEAT does not control its operations. The exchange can cease operations leaving the smart contracts as the only means of accessing funds transferred to the exchange.
- **Smart Contracts**: The smart contracts utilized by the dYdX exchange are authored by StarkWare Ltd. and other respective authors or organizations. L2BEAT is not responsible for the functionality or security of these smart contracts or any other underlying systems.

## **3. User Responsibilities, Risks, and Disclaimers**

### **3.1. User Responsibility**

- **Verification**: Users must verify all actions through their own Ethereum wallets. Users are responsible for confirming that any transaction they approve aligns with their intentions.
- **Independent Validation**: Users should independently validate the details of any smart contract interactions initiated via the Explorer.
- **Independent Submission:** To sign and submit blockchain transactions created with the help of the Explorer users have to use a wallet application of their choice. L2BEAT does neither cover nor receive any fees that the user pays for having their transaction executed on the blockchain.

### **3.2. No Guarantees or Warranties**

The Explorer is provided without any guarantees of availability, reliability, or accuracy. L2BEAT does not warrant that the Explorer will be error-free or uninterrupted. L2BEAT makes no representation regarding the accuracy of any data or information presented within the Explorer.

### **3.3. Limitation of Liability**

You expressly understand and agree that L2BEAT, its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, agents, partners, and licensors shall not be liable to you for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, the cost of procuring substitute goods or services, or other intangible losses (even if L2BEAT has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from any of the following:

### **3.5. Acknowledgement of Risks and Responsibilities**

By using the Explorer or interacting with the site in any way, you acknowledge and understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems. You warrant that you have a sufficient understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, such as Ether (ETH), smart contract-based tokens like those adhering to the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20), and blockchain-based software systems.

L2BEAT does not own or control the underlying software or hardware that forms and operates blockchain networks. The software for blockchain networks is generally open source, allowing anyone to use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Explorer, you acknowledge and agree that:

1. **No Control Over Blockchain Networks**: L2BEAT is not responsible for the operation, functionality, security, or availability of the underlying software, hardware, and networks, which may experience disruptions or failures.
2. **Risks of Forks**: The underlying protocols of blockchain networks may be subject to sudden changes in operating rules, known as "Forks." Such Forks may materially affect the Explorer, and L2BEAT may decide, at its discretion, not to support (or to cease supporting) a Forked network. You acknowledge and agree that L2BEAT assumes no responsibility for the underlying software protocols, whether Forked or not.

The networks utilized by the Explorer rely on public/private key cryptography. You are solely responsible for securing and protecting your private keys or other access credentials and hardware equipment used to access digital assets. L2BEAT does not have access to or custody of your private keys or digital assets.

**Loss of Private Keys**: Losing control of your private keys will result in permanent and irreversible denial of access to your digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain or any other network. If your private keys are lost or compromised, neither L2BEAT nor any other person can retrieve or protect your digital assets. In such cases, you will not be able to transfer your digital assets or realize their value or utility.

## **4. Use at Your Own Risk**

- Users engage with the Explorer entirely at their own risk. By using the Explorer, you acknowledge that blockchain-based services have inherent risks, including but not limited to potential software bugs, vulnerabilities, and financial loss.
